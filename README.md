This article is part of a series where NLP techniques will be used to understand Cement Industry ESG data. 
In Part-I we are covering following ,
* Step I: Understanding Cement 
* Step II: Natural Language Processing : Data Sourcing, Data Cleanup and Extraction from an unstructured sustainability report containing text, tables, and images.
* Step III: Natural Language Processing: Model Training
* III(a): Supervised Learning approach — Labeling and Training a classification model.
* III(b): Unsupervised Learning approach : Create a pre-trained Cement Industry specific LDA algorithm, let’s call it ‘LDA_Cement_GHG_Model’
Step IV : Model Testing — Running ‘LDA_Cement_GHG_Model’ on a new sustainability report
